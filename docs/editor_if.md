### Frame Sequence Display {.western}

The eSpeak editor can display a number of frame-sequencies in tabbed
windows. Each frame can contain a short-time frequency spectrum,
covering the period of one cycle at the sound's pitch. Frames can also
show:

### Text Tab {.western}

Enter text in the top left text window. Click the **Translate** button
to see the phonetic transcription in the text window below. Then click
the **Speak** button to speak the text and show the results in the
**Prosody** tab, if that is open.

If changes are made in the **Prosody** tab, then clicking **Speak** will
speak the modified prosody while **Translate** will revert to the
default prosody settings for the text.

To enter phonetic symbols (Kirschenbaum encoding) in the top left text
window, enclose them within [[ ]].
